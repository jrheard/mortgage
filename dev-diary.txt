spun up a simple little clojure sandbox to play around with mortgage math
so i can wrap my head around this stuff a bit better.

i've mainly been doing this because i wanted to try out intellij+cursive, which i'm liking
a lot so far. i've got to memorize a ton of keyboard shortcuts, but it seems like a very
powerful environment, and it's easy to keep it minimal. its vim integration is fantastic,
it even has splits!

right now i've got some functions/schemas that encode mortgages and do simple math.

questions i currently want this program to answer:

* given several mortgages, tell me which one's "best"
* how should i reason about paying off a 30-year in 15 years, vs
    paying it off in 30 years and investing the extra money in the stock market?
* say i want to sell my house in 9 years (for instance). how does that affect
    which mortgage is best? do i want to have paid it off aggressively or slowly?

i'm thinking about converting the project to clojurescript and spinning up a simple
reagent-powered UI with sliders/etc for interest rates/etc. not for any particularly good
reason other than just wanting to see how cursive plays with clojurescript. might try
that tomorrow.
